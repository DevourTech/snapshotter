  Generate Tag:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:

    - name: Create tag with Github SHA and timestamp
      uses: DevourTech/snapshotter@v1.1
      with:
        BASE_VERSION: v0.0.0
```

###  Outputs

## Workflow

- Add this action to your workflow file
- Commit some changes
- push either to **master** or any other branch specified in the workflow
- On **push (or merge)**, the action will:
    - Get the latest commit hash and timestamp
    - Generate a custom string using the above two arguments

### NOTE

This action only generates a custom string which can be used as an ouput to release a tag with custom name.
If you also want to use this string to release a tag to `GitHub`, add this action [GitHub Script](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/github-script)
to your workflow file .
